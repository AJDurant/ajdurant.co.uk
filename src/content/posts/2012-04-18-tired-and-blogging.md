So I got back to York today, and after an evening of actually doing some work, then not a lot decided to have an earlier night. It was going to be the earliest for a few weeks.

But guess what? I'm still awake, it turns out after a long day travelling after not much sleep last night I can't get to sleep :/ and I didn't even sleep on the train...

Oh well time won't be wasted, if I can't sleep then I might as well queue up a few blog posts.

I apologise in advance if the quality of the next few posts that show up aren't of the quality I'd usually atain for. Although you might not think the usual is up to much anyway :p
