So, after messing around with iptables this afternoon on my server I thought I should write a blog post about it (more on that soon). However this required me to actually have a blog to post in!

Having a blog on the site was always in the back of my mind, but until now I had not done any work on it. So for the past hour or so I've been doing a few edits to the design to make it work as a template. It's still got a bit to go for all the blog features to be supported in the site template, but it's enough there to launch, so that's good.

Anyway, time to write about iptables! =)
