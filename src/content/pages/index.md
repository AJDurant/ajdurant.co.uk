Welcome, I'm Andy, a Software Engineer in York, I'm a Christian, and I'm interested in embedded systems and web development.

## Who am I?

I work for [Rapita Systems](https://www.rapitasystems.com/ "Rapita Systems - on target verification") predominantly in Ada and C programming.

I studied Computer with Embedded Systems Engineering MEng at the University of York, and whilst I was there was very involved at [URY](https://ury.org.uk "University Radio York"), the University's student radio station. In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, rock climbing, making websites and writing code.

As well as all that, I am a live sound engineer & non-professional music producer. I also am the producer for the [National Award Winning Biscuit News](https://www.mixcloud.com/RealBiscuitNews/ "Biscuit News Podcast") which is now a ridiculous podcast.

I am a general technophile, I like gadgets and computery things.
