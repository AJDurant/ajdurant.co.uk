After several hours work installing dependancies then redoing bits that went wrong, I successfully managed to compile and install liquidsoap from source and get it fully running with init.d script and stuff. This may not sound like a big deal, but it made me pretty pleased, especially as I haven’t really done anything like it before. Also somewhere along the way I managed to forget that today was Saturday, and Sunday comes afterwards… More on liquidsoap soon :)
