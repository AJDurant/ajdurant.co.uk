So it’s been a little since my last post, and I’m currently leaving you hanging as to what to do with iptables. So I thought I ought to write a quick post. Tbh it’s probably not even been that long, but it feels like it. I’ve just come to the end of my first week of summer term, which has been good fun. It’s nice to be back into the swing of things at York, and it’s also nice to have a slightly less busy timetable than last term. I’ve still got lots planned, for this blog and the website in general, so hopefully those will slowly weedle their way out over the next few weeks. Obviously uni work is going to take priority, and I’m not going to keep posting “sorry no posts” blogs. Personally I see no point. If you’re not posting even vaugely good or interesting content, then there isn’t a lot of point in it. So my blog will probably stay fairly sporadic with blocks of posts when I have time to write them and some biggish gaps in between. But I see nothing wrong with that, as it means I aim for (generally) higher quality posts, than rushed mediocre posts. So this will probably be the only blog post about not posting often, and I only see that as a good thing =)
